# Idea board 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Build an idea board that allows a user to create new ideas, edit existing ideas or delete them. Each idea should be represented as a tile on the board that displays a title, description and created/updated time. The title and description should be editable inline. The description text should have a max length of 140 characters. There should also be a button on the tile that allows for it to be deleted.
